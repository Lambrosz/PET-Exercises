It is mainly making the assumption that the distribution of traffic from

of anomalously high traffic between our target and the suspects.

For example: 

If sender A (not our target sender), is sending messages to receiver B
continuously (i.e. at each observed round), then receiver B will appear in
all of the receiver lists we observe when looking for suspects for our target.
Therefore it would appear that our target was communicating with receiver B,
